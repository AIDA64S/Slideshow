# Slideshow

Slideshow is a Minecraft mod that adds a Slideshow Projector block. This block can project online images (including GIF's) into the world.

This fork is a multi-build (Fabric and Forge) adaptation of [TeaConMC's Slide Show](https://github.com/teaconmc/SlideShow) under the BSD-3-Clause license.

Simply right-click the block to open the GUI and paste in the URL to the image. There are also several options to adjust the dimensions, offset, and orientation. Hover over these icons for more details.
